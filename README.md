# simpleCalculator
This part of a technical test for a junior position.

## Objectives:
Create an application using PHP.

The app is a small calculator that accepts 4 inputs:
    -username   (mandatory)
    -operand_1  (mandatory)
    -operand_2  (mandatory)
    -operand_3  (optional)

The content of these fields must be numerical or alphanumerical.

If all 3 operators are numerical the it needs to sum them,
if not a concatenation will be the operation to do.

The application must show the result of the operation or a message if any of the mandatory fields are not filled.

Each operation needs to be stored in memmory, saving the name of the user who submits it.

If an operation has been submited already, the result but also the name of the previous user who submited it will be displayed.
